As a music enjoyer, I want to quiz how much about artists I know, so that I can learn more about them

When I open the webpage,
Then I want to have a play button so I can start the game
When I click the play button,
Then I want it to generate a picture or top hits of random artist
When I want to guess the artist, 
Then I want to have a text input to enter my answer
When I guess the name of the artist right, 
Then I get add 1 point to my score
When I guess the name of the artist wrong, 
Then I will get a review of the correct artist's information 
When I get all of the questions right, 
Then I get a surprise at the end(can change vary)
When I get one or more questions wrong, 
Then I will get a "Sorry you lost"(can change) and a retry button
